** ngrok -- utility of webhooks in this particular code -- to get walletid/address? 
**  webhook connecting our application to bitgo wallet? updating bitgo which address to pay given oracle info?

<!-- difference between webhook and api: https://sendgrid.com/blog/webhook-vs-api-whats-difference/ -->
<!-- APIs can share data or functionality. -->


<!-- WEBHOOKS: ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

	A webhook lets a developer provide a URL to which an API will send data.  -->

<!-- webhooks reverse APIs, but perhaps more accurately a webhook lets you skip a step -->
<!-- you register a URL with the company providing the service. That URL is a place within your application that will accept the data and do something with it. In some cases, you can tell the provider the situations when you’d like to receive data. Whenever there’s something new, the webhook will send it to your URL. -->

<!-- providing data as-needed/ -->

<!-- your application has to register a callback URI. When the event is triggered, Metwit does a POST request on the callback URI. The POST payload is the Monitor monitor object which triggered the event in JSON format. -->

<!-- // ngrok exposes local networked services behinds NATs and firewalls to the
//     public internet over a secure tunnel. Share local websites, build/test
//     webhook consumers and self-host personal services.
//     Detailed help for each command is available with 'ngrok help <command>'.
//     Open http://localhost:4040 for ngrok's web interface to inspect traffic. -->
