// Register your application to get an API client credentials. You will need a Fitbit account (free) to register an app.

	// We strongly recommend that you find an OAuth library for your programming language and web framework.


// Read about the details of the Fitbit API:
// OAuth Authentication shows you how to request permission to access a user's data.
		// Fitbit uses OAuth 2.0 for user authorization and API authentication. The OAuth 2.0 framework requires your application to obtain an Access Token when the Fitbit user authorizes your app to access their data. The Access Token is used for making HTTP request to the Fitbit API

// 		For security consideration, the OAuth 2.0 authorization page must be presented in a dedicated browser view. Fitbit users can only confirm they are authenticating with the genuine Fitbit.com site if they have they have the tools provided by the browser, such as the URL bar and Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate information.

// // For native applications, this means the authorization page must open in the default browser. Native applications can use custom URL schemes as callback URIs to redirect the user back from the browser to the application requesting permission.
// Web applications may use a pop-up window, so long as the URL bar is visible.




// The documentation links here explain each of the API calls to read or write user data. You can try any API request using the API Explorer.

// Subscriptions API explains how to subscribe to changes in a user's data to always have the freshest data.

// Find an OAuth 2.0 library for your programming language and framework to create an authorization flow.

// Make API requests with the authorized user's credentials.



// You can make 150 API requests per hour for each user that has authorized your application to access their data.
